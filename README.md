# **🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis & Recommendation Project**

---

## **📌 Project Overview**
A restaurant consolidator aims to revamp its B2C portal using intelligent automation technologies. This project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on restaurant datasets to understand data behavior, clean inconsistencies, and derive meaningful insights to identify **star restaurants** and support recommendation generation.

The analysis focuses on geographical distribution, franchise presence, cuisine popularity, delivery and booking options, cost trends, and factors influencing restaurant ratings. Interactive dashboards are created using Tableau to help visualize insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## **📊 Datasets**
This project uses two datasets:
- **restaurants_data.xlsx** – Contains restaurant information with 19 attributes such as ratings, votes, cuisines, cost for two, delivery option, and table booking.
- **Country-Code.xlsx** – Contains country codes and corresponding country names.

Both datasets are stored in the **data/** folder.

## **🛠️ Tools & Technologies**
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Tableau (Dashboard Visualization)**
- **GitHub (Version Control)**

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

#### **Geographical Distribution**
- Analyzed restaurant presence across countries and cities.
- Identified cities with the **maximum and minimum number of restaurants**.
- Visualized global restaurant distribution using a geographical map.

#### **Franchise National Presence**
- Determined franchises with the highest national presence.
- Popular chains such as **Barbeque Nation, Pizza Hut, KFC, McDonald’s, and Domino’s** showed strong multi-city coverage.

#### **Online Delivery & Table Booking**
- Compared restaurants offering online delivery vs those that do not.
- Analyzed table booking availability and its relationship with customer engagement.
- Observed that a significant portion of restaurants provide online delivery, indicating high customer demand for convenience.

#### **Cuisine Analysis**
- Identified **Top 10 cuisines** served across cities.
- North Indian cuisine emerged as the most popular cuisine.
- Restaurants serving multiple cuisines generally attracted higher customer interest.

#### **Cost Distribution**
- Studied cost for two across different cities and restaurants.
- Most restaurants fall within a moderate cost range, while premium restaurants are limited to specific cities.

#### **Ratings & Votes Analysis**
- Analyzed distribution of restaurant ratings.
- Studied the relationship between ratings and:
  - Cost for two  
  - Number of cuisines  
  - Online delivery option  
  - Table booking availability  
  - Number of votes
